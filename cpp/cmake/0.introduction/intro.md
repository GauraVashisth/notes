# CMake:

## 1. definition:
- tool taht generates native build system files.
- making porject portable across different systems and envirnoments.

## â€¢ nede  of cmake:
- Cross_Platform Build System
  - can generate platform-specific build files, from a single configuration file (CMakeLists.txt).

- simplifies build system maintenance
  - writing and maintaining platform specific build scripts is tedious and error prone.

- Dependency Management
  - help manage dependencies and link libraries easily.

- Complex Projects
  - large projects, with multiple source files and dependencies, CMake simplifies the process of defining and managing build configurations.

- out-of-source builds
  - cmake encourages a clean separation of source code and build artifacts by supporting "out-of-source builds".
  - this avoid polluting the source directory with build files.

- Integration with IDEs
  - modern IDEs have build-in support for CMake.

- Support for modern c++ features
  - simplifies enabling modern c++ standards, by allowing you to set compiler flag easily, using cmd like:
  ```cpp
  set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 21)
  ```

## working of cmake:
1. define build rules in CMakeLists.txt
  ```bash
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
  project(MyProject)
  # specify the executable
  add_executable(MyExecutable main.cpp)
  ```

2. configure the build system
  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  ```

3. build the project
  ```bash
  make
  ```
