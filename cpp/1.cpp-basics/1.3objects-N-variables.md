## Data and values:

- **data** is any info that can be _moved, processed, or stored_ by a computer.
- a porgram can acquire data to work w/ in many ways:
  1. from a file/ database
  2. over a network
  3. from user provided input
- **value** is a single piece of data.

## Random Access Memory:

- RAM can be visualized as a series of numbered of boxes that can be used to store data while the program is running.
- when a program run, **OS** loads th porgram into RAM. data that is hardcoded into program, is loaded at this point.

## Objects and variables:

- in cpp, **direct memory access** is discouraged.
- **object** represents a region of storage that can hold a value in memory.
- object w/ a name is called **variable**.
- in general programming, *object* refers to unnamed object in a memory, a variable or a function.
